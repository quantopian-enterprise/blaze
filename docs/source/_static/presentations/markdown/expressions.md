# Expressions


* SymPy expressions...
    * encode mathematical equations as Python objects
    * generate numeric, high-performance, code
    * enable mathematical reasoning

<hr>

We combine high-level reasoning and low-level performance.


* Blaze expressions...
    * encode relational and linear algebra, rather than calculus and trigonometry
    * interpret to other systems
    * enable data reasoning
    * are extensible (in a way that keeps you sane)

<hr>

We combine high-level reasoning and low-level performance.


## Take-aways

* Separating expressions from computation ...
    1.  enables users to transition easily between compute backends (right tool for
        the job)
    2.  enables developers to focus on user interface
    3.  enables developers to focus on computational backends
    4.  shares reasoning and query optimizations across backends
    5.  eases growth of Blaze to new backends when they arise
